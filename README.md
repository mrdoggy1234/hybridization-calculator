# Hybridization Calculator
A convenient web app for calculating the hybridization of a molecule. Work in progress; probably won't be completely finished but is still functional.
## Instructions
Select the central atom of the molecule then any surrounding atoms. Add pi bonds if the molecule contains any. The hybridization will appear automatically.
